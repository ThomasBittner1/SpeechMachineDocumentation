# FAQ

### Does it limit me as an animator?
No it doesn't. It just creates clean animation curves that you can either leave or adjust as needed. You can also
completely delete the keyframes on some sections and replace it with your own.   
The Speech-Machine is really just to help you in cases where there's tons of speech and you don't have the time
to animate the lips for each word.
