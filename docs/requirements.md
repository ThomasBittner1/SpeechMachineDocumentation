You can make the Speech Machine work with any rig, but to get the best results possible it’s recommended to have all the controls listed on this page.
The speech machine only animates your controls. While the responsibility to get good shapes is still in the hands of the rigger, the speech machine only helps the animator.

For each of those points listed below you don’t need just one single attribute. If more than one attributes are required to achieve those, it’ll work. 
Just keep in mind you might get issues if you use one control attribute for more than one point. More details about that in the Tutorial (Multiple Control Usages)

- Jaw Open
- Mouth Corners In and Out 
- Upperlip Raiser
- Lowerlip Depressor
- Funnel
- Lippress, Cheek Puff
- MouthClose – lips closing when jaw is open
