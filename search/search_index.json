The speech machine only animates your controls. While the responsibility to get good shapes is still in the hands of the rigger, the speech machine only helps the animator.</p> <p>For each of those points listed below you don\u2019t need just one single attribute. If more than one attributes are required to achieve those, it\u2019ll work.  Just keep in mind you might get issues if you use one control attribute for more than one point.

To see that in action, watch the  Speech-Machine for Riggers video.</p> <p>The Setup process of the Speech-Machine is mapping the controls in your rig to the Containers. During this process you are working with the tool similar to how animators are working with it \u2013 the character rig needs to be referenced in scene, and at the top of the UI the namespace needs to be specified by selecting any control and clicking Set from Selected at the top of the UI.</p> <p>This has the advantage that later even animators can make adjustments to the settings on the Setup Node and send back to rigging to update it in the rig.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#setup-node","title":"Setup Node","text":"<p>First we need to understand how the Setup Node works. The Setup Node is called speechMachineSetup and it\u2019s a simple transform node with tons of float and string attributes.</p> <p>Never adjust those attributes directly, unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing. The way to adjust those attributes is by going to the Setup Jaw/Lips/Tongue tab and from top to bottom fill and calibrate the fields.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#titles-attach-transform","title":"Titles Attach Transform","text":"<p>In the Setup Jaw/Lips/Tongue tab at the top you can find Titles Attach Transform.</p> <p>Here you specify the transform where the subtitles are being attached to and where they are located. This won\u2019t have any impact to the end result, but I recommend to specify it properly, so the titles are appearing nicely above the head.</p> <p>Simply select the head control for example, click the 3 dots button next to Titles Attach Transform and click Set Transform from Selected.</p> <p>This will create and select a plane called NAMESPACE::TitlesGuide. Move it so it\u2019s located above the head.</p> <p>You might notice that in the UI the field on the right side has some some confusing looking numbers and it\u2019s changing as you move the planes. This is just a mirror to an attribute in the Setup Node which is storing the offset matrix of the plane relative to the transform that you specified.</p> <p>Later, if the Subtitles appear too big or too small, simply adjust the plane.  </p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#jaw-container","title":"Jaw Container","text":"<p>The first 3 lines are the most important</p> <p>Select your jaw control attribute while it is in default pose (should be closed), click the 3 dots button next to Jaw Ctrl and in the dropdown menu that appears click Set From Selected.</p> <p>Now we need to specify the jaw in the open pose. Simply pose the jaw, click the 3 dots button next to Jaw Pose and in the appearing drop down menu click Set Current Pose.</p> <p>Then play with the Jaw Open Test slider below. If the jaw opens and closes correctly, it worked.</p> <p>And then set the jaw percentages of where the jaw should be on the S (Jaw % for S) and TH (Jaw % for TH) sounds. For the S, just make sure the tip of the teeth are meeting. In most rigs that would be 0 %. And for TH, just make sure the gap between the teeth is wide enough so the tip of the tongue has space to go inbetween.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#other-containers","title":"Other Containers","text":"<p>Before moving further, let\u2019s make sure we know what exactly a Container is. The speech-machine has those containers:</p> <ul> <li>Jaw \u2013 we\u2019ve done this already above</li> <li>CornerInOut \u2013 In the UI they are split into CornerIn, CornerOut</li> <li>UpperUp \u2013 Upperlip Raiser</li> <li>LowerDown \u2013 Lowerlip Depressor</li> <li>Funnel \u2013 SH, RR \u2013 Lips going forward</li> <li>Puff - for longer and harder P \u2013 lips pressing and cheeks puffing slightly</li> <li>MouthClose \u2013 lips closing, also when jaw is open</li> <li>lower FFF \u2013 bottom lips touching the teeth</li> <li>Zipper</li> <li>Tongue Up \u2013 N, L, T, D</li> <li>Tongue TH \u2013 The typical English sound TH</li> <li> <p>Tongue Back \u2013 K, G</p> </li> <li> <p>Internally the Speech Machine is calculating an animation for each container. What we have to do with the UI is mapping our controls to the containers. And we already did one \u2013 the jaw.</p> </li> </ul> <p>While the simple containers (like the Jaw, UpperUp, LowerDown) just have a Ctrls field and a Pose field, some have 2 Pose fields (MouthClose, lower FFF, all the Tongue Containers). One for when Jaw is at default, and one for when jaw is open. They all need to be set properly.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#multiple-control-usage","title":"Multiple Control usage","text":"<p>In most cases, each control attribute in the rig should not be used more than once.</p> <p>For example if you have a control attribute upper_ctrl.translateY that you specify for the upperUp container and for the mouthClosed container at the same time, you will immediately get a warning.</p> <p>But the tool will still work, except that the result will be baked keys instead of clean keys. If you are ok with this, then don\u2019t worry and feel free to use controls more than once.</p> <p>Actually for the tongue this could be acceptable in many cases since animators are more likely not going to need to adjust the tongue animation.</p> <p>One exception is the cornerIn and cornerOut containers. You can have a control that will get negative values from the cornerIn container, and positive values from the cornerOut container. Because those containers under the hood are actually combined into one container.</p> <p>Another exception is the Puff Container. Since internally this is more like a post effect, it can handle it if there are already extisting control attributes defined here.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#finish-the-setup","title":"Finish the Setup","text":"<p>Now that you know what containers are and how they work \u2013 let\u2019s from top to bottom and map the Ctrls and Poses for each container.</p> <p>Always remember to use the test sliders to see if things are set correctly!</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#bringing-the-setup-node-into-the-rig","title":"Bringing the setup node into the rig","text":"<p>When you are done mapping and calibrating your controls, simply duplicate the setup node, so it\u2019s just named speechMachineSetup without namespace, and import that into your rig.</p> <p>So next time you reference your rig, this node gets reference with the correct namespace</p> <p>Also make sure you only have that node in the rig only once to avoid clashing names.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#kangaroo-builder","title":"Kangaroo Builder","text":"<p>If you are using Kangaroo Builder, you can click the Fill Commands with Setup Node button to store the settings.
